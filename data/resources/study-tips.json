    "content": "<h3>The Pomodoro Technique</h3><p>This is a game-changer for focus. Study in 25-minute, uninterrupted blocks, then take a 5-minute break. After four blocks, take a longer 15-30 minute break. This method combats burnout and helps you stay focused during your study sessions.</p><h3>Active Recall & The Feynman Technique</h3><p>Don't just re-read your notes. Actively test yourself by trying to recall information without looking. A great way to do this is the Feynman Technique: try to explain a concept in simple terms, as if you were teaching it to someone younger. If you get stuck, you've found a gap in your knowledge to go back and review.</p><h3>Past Papers are Gold</h3><p>There is no better way to prepare for HSC exams than by doing past papers under timed conditions. It helps you understand the exam format, identify common question types, and manage your time effectively. Start with older papers and save the most recent ones for your final weeks of prep.</p>"
