    "content": "<h3>Plan Your Week Ahead</h3>\r\n<p>Use a planner, diary, or digital calendar to schedule your week. Block out study time, assignments, extracurriculars, and even downtime. Having a visual plan helps reduce last-minute stress and keeps you on top of deadlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prioritise with the \u201cTo-Do List\u201d Method</h3>\r\n<p>Each day, write a short list of 3\u20135 key tasks you want to complete. Prioritise them by importance and urgency. Ticking off completed items gives a sense of accomplishment and keeps you motivated.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Break Big Tasks into Smaller Steps</h3>\r\n<p>Feeling overwhelmed by a big assignment or exam prep? Break it into smaller, manageable steps and tackle one at a time. This makes work feel less daunting and easier to start.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use the Two-Minute Rule</h3>\r\n<p>If a task takes less than two minutes \u2014 like replying to an email or filing notes \u2014 do it right away. This rule helps clear small tasks quickly so they don\u2019t pile up and distract you from bigger ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Set Goals That Motivate You</h3>\r\n<p>Create both long-term (term goals) and short-term (weekly goals) to stay focused. Make sure your goals are specific, realistic, and measurable \u2014 like \"Finish History essay draft by Friday\" instead of \"Work on essay sometime.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Avoid Multitasking \u2014 Focus on One Thing</h3>\r\n<p>Switching between tasks actually slows you down and lowers the quality of your work. Give your full attention to one subject or task at a time. You\u2019ll finish faster and remember more too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Protect Your Downtime</h3>\r\n<p>Rest is just as important as study. Schedule regular breaks, sleep, and time to relax or spend with friends and family. A well-rested brain performs better and handles stress more easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Review Your Routine Weekly</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of each week, take 10 minutes to reflect: What worked? What didn\u2019t? Adjust your schedule and habits accordingly. Small changes over time can lead to big improvements in productivity and balance.</p>"
