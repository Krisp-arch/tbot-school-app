    "content": "<h3>Organise Your Notes by Topic</h3>\r\n<p>Keep your notes tidy and topic-focused. Use headings, bullet points, and subheadings to break down complex ideas into smaller chunks. This makes it easier to review later and helps you quickly locate what you need when revising.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use Colour Coding Strategically</h3>\r\n<p>Colour code your notes using highlighters or different coloured pens to help categorise information\u2014like key terms, definitions, examples, and diagrams. Don\u2019t overdo it though; stick to a consistent colour scheme so it actually aids your memory rather than distracting you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Cornell Method for Note-Taking</h3>\r\n<p>This effective note-taking system divides your page into three sections: a narrow left column for notes during class, a wider right column for main ideas, and a bottom section for summaries. After class, write a brief summary of the lesson in your own words to reinforce learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Make Flashcards for Key Concepts</h3>\r\n<p>Create flashcards for formulas, vocabulary, dates, or definitions. You can use physical cards or apps like Quizlet or Anki. Regularly testing yourself with flashcards improves retention and makes revision more interactive and engaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Summarise After Each Study Session</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of each study session, spend 5 minutes summarising what you\u2019ve learned. Write a short paragraph or list of key takeaways. This practice strengthens memory and gives you a quick reference for future revision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use Mind Maps for Visual Learners</h3>\r\n<p>Mind maps are a great way to visually organise information. Start with a central idea and branch out into related topics and details. They\u2019re especially useful for making connections between concepts and seeing the bigger picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Review Daily, Not Just Before Exams</h3>\r\n<p>Spaced repetition is a powerful technique. Review your notes a little each day instead of cramming before tests. Even 10\u201315 minutes daily can significantly improve long-term retention and reduce stress during exam time.</p>"
