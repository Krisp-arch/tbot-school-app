    "content": "<h3>What is an ATAR?</h3><p>The Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) isn't a score, it's a rank that shows your position relative to all other students in your age group in NSW. It's designed to be a fair way for universities to select students. It's calculated from your best 2 units of English and your next best 8 units.</p><h3>Prerequisites vs. Assumed Knowledge</h3><p>When looking at uni courses, pay close attention to these terms. A <strong>prerequisite</strong> is a subject you *must* have completed to be considered for a course. <strong>Assumed knowledge</strong> means the university expects you to have reached a certain level of knowledge (like completing HSC Maths Advanced) and will teach the course accordingly, but you can still get in without it (though you might find it harder).</p><h3>Choose Subjects You Enjoy and Are Good At</h3><p>This is the most important advice. Don't choose a subject just because you think it 'scales well'. Scaling adjusts for the strength of the student cohort in a subject, not the difficulty of the subject itself. You will almost always get a better result in a subject you are genuinely interested in and have an aptitude for, than in a subject you struggle with or dislike, regardless of scaling.</p>"
